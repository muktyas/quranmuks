Mushaf Alquran indonesian layout (Indopak) but using the new Utsman Toha's fonts.

The pdf file is true vector font. So it is not brake if we zoom it.
You can open it with inkscape to beautify them, maybe in frame, or maybe you want to add the translate of it.

The odt file is the source of the pdf. You can open it using libreoffice writer (or ms. word), but first you must install the font files (opentype).
For linux user, we can install to /usr/share/fonts/opentype

The background of this project is from here:
https://github.com/quran/quran_android/issues/575

The font file I use from Indonesian quran kemenag.
http://quran.kemenag.go.id/app/source/FONT_STANDAR.zip (but the link is not exist now). So I put it
in my gdrive here:
https://drive.google.com/open?id=1R8LQGTp7z9G3J74EEbhowc9tbaCMEMZx
But it still not correct font. We must correct it manually. Example: we change the font pcf_001 become MSI_Z001.

The example result is like this:
